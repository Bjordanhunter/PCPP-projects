These are some projects I made as part of my PCPP course (PCPP1 1/5 Advanced Object-Oriented Programming and Classes on edube.org) focussing on learning about classes, instances, attributes, and methods; shallow and deep operations, polymorphism, special methods, static and class methods, abstract classes, method overriding, composition, inheritance, subclassing, encapsulation, advanced techniques of exception handling, serialization of Python objects (the pickle module), the shelve module, decorators, and metaprogramming.
