These are some projects I made as part of my PCPP course (PCPP1 5/5  on edube.org) focussing on learning how to interact with SQLite databases (the sqlite3 module), create and process XML files (the xml module), read, write and process csv files (the csv module), create and process log messages from Python programs (the logging module), and manage configuration files (the configparser module).
